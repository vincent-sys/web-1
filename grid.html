      <div>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
        present the same markup page in different styles for different
        rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
        (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
        and on Braille-based tactile devices.
        CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
        accessed on a mobile device.</div>
