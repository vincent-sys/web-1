  <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/">The HyperText Markup Language</a>,<br>
  or HTML is the standard markup language<br>
  for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
  It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading<br>
  Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
  <br><br>
  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
  With HTML constructs, images and other objects<br>
  such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
  HTML provides a means to create structured documents<br>
  by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,<br>
  paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
  HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.<br>
  Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page.<br>
  Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about<br>
  document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br>
  Browsers do not display the HTML tags,<br>
  but use them to interpret the content of the page.
  <br><br>
  HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language<br>
  such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br>
  Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.<br>
  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), <br>
  former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,<br>
  has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]<br>

  contains a lot of lines

  ignores it.
